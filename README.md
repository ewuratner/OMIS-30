# OMIS-30
These were projects I did with a partner (Roulette and the Roulette Web Application) or by myself during Fall 2019 in my Introduction
to Programming class at Santa Clara University. 

Project II had us create a game (the suggested game was Blackjack but we chose Roulette instead) that the user could play in their Python
console and required the use of user validations, globalization, and understanding how to clean up our code through functions.

Project III had each of us find a dataset online and use the pandas library to analyze it as an introduction to data analysis. We were
required to find 3 interesting facts and support them with graphs and tables.

Project IV required us to learn HTML basics to bring our Project II to life on our local browser. My partner and I used online forms to
simplify the betting process and tried to simplify user experience through validation during the betting page and automatic bet correction
if the user bets more than their account balance.
